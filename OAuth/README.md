# OAuth 2.0 with Python

OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6749) is an authorization framework enabling third-party applications to obtain limited access to HTTP services on behalf of a resource owner. It focuses on authorization (not authentication, though often paired with OpenID Connect). Use it for secure API access without sharing credentials.
